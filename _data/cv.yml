    - title: SURF Undergraduate Researcher
      institution: California Institute of Technology | Betty Hong Lab
      year: 2023.6 - Now
      Description:
      
        - Built a connectome-based large-scale (1300 neurons) neural ODE network simulation of fruit flies anterior visual pathway with Pytorch.
        
        - Developed a low-budget, multicolor closed-loop virtual reality for fruit flies using a wind-powered treadmill, Unity environment, 
          and flexible screen to create a real-world environment for multiple navigation behavior experiments.
        
        - Created and performed different behavioral experiments combined with transgenic fruit flies to characterize ring neurons function in the navigation; 
          found a specific behavioral pattern change resulting from silencing ring neurons during fixation behavior with certain visual patterns.

      institution: University of California, Santa Barbara | Sung Soo Kim Lab
      year: 2021.9 - Now
      Description:
      
        -Designed and performed multiple behavioral experiments quantifying fruit flies' behavioral change after early age natural
        odor exposure.
        
        -Constructed a behavioral apparatus for odor delivery and real-time position tracking to quantify fruit flies' odor-encountering
        behavior.
        
        -Develop R and MATLAB scripts for automatic cleaning and analyzing behavioral data across large data sets (10000 trials); discovered a specific dynamic pattern change after
        early odor exposure.
        
        -Utilized transgenic flies for elucidating neural mechanisms of behavioral change after fruit fliesâ€™ odor experience.

    - title: Undergraduate Research Assistant
      institution: Zhejiang University | Xiao Dong Wang Lab
      year: 2021.6 - 2021.9
        -Constructed a Y-maze and its two-photo imaging parts to study the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) of mice and its relationship
        with anxiety.
        -Analyzed two-photon microscopy data from LEC of mice and its behavioral data in Y-maze using principal component analysis
        and support vector machines; discovered a subset of neurons in LEC related to anxiety behavior.
