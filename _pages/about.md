Hi! I'm an undergraduate at UCSB studying Computational Neuroscience.

My current research topic includes understanding the temporal dynamic of neurons and behavior using deep learning(New), ODE simulation(Classic), and virtual reality.

I enjoy watching random cat YouTube videos, listening to jazz, and playing video games in my spare time.
