Hi! I'm an undergraduate at UCSB studying Neuroscience, with an additional major in Computer Science and a minor in Music. I love neuroscience, both behavioral and computational part. My current research topic includes in understanding the temporal dynamic of a neuron using deep learning, and ODE simulation.

In my spare time, I enjoy creating small coding projects and listen to jazz.
